# **Module 11 UFOs Challenge**

## **Overview of Project:**
### **Purpose of the Analysis**

The purpose of this challenge was to take the JavaScript UFO sightings data that Dana collected and create a html website that would display her article about UFOs as well as display the table in an easy to read table. She also wanted the table to be easily filtered based on the inputs from the users. By allowing this table to use filters, each user could narrow down the information they wanted to look at based on five different categories. 

## **Results**

For a user to use the webpage to review the UFO sightings data they will arrive at the homepage that looks like this below:

You will see on the website that in the top section is the article about the sightings and general background information. 

Below the article is the filter search buttons - there are five ways to filter through the sightings data. The filters are: date, city, state, country, and shape.

When using the filter, you will decide what category you would like to start with. As an example, I used "or" as Oregon to begin with which results in 3 entries.

Then to narrow down the results even more, I added the date of 1/12/2010 which gave us two total entries. 
![2nd filter](/Resources/Filter%20by%20State%20and%20Date.png)

You can put as little as one filter or continue to add up to all 5 filters to look at the specific data you are interested in. 


## Summary
### **Drawback and Recommendations**

The one drawback regarding this website design would be that there is a limited data set from one year which is just a snapshot of time. It would be helpful to have additional data points to truly solidify the sightings. Although it's showing sightings there doesn't seem to be any consistent trends when just looking at the table and filtering it. 

The recommendations that I have for furthering the development of the website would be to add an interactive map of the United States and drop pins on all the sightings reported which would give a much more visual idea of where they are happening. I would also suggest that we also create graphical visualizations that would mark certain trends based on the table data and hopefully with additional data so there is more data to help show more significant trends.
